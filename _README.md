# :sunflower: :deciduous_tree: :tulip: :blossom: Welcome to my PL garden :rose: :seedling: :hibiscus: :herb:

<!-- I think type systems, type theory, formal logic, proof theory and formal reasoning are really interesting topics. -->
I build small programming languages, theorem provers, and other systems related to PLT concepts.

## I sometimes write about the things I learn [:pencil2: **in my digital notepad** :blue_book:](http://writing.lambdu.li)
The latest published post was a report on [Propositions as Types ⭐](http://writing.lambdu.li/reports/propositions-as-types)


## What I am growing now :seedling:

### [Detour](https://github.com/lambduli/detour) :four_leaf_clover: :tulip:

Detour is a small proof-checker for a mix of _Second-order Propositional Logic_ and _First-order Predicate Logic_ *Natural Deduction* proofs in *Fitch-style notation*.

It is a first step into the area of proof-checkers and (interactive) proof assistants.
I picked the Fitch-style notation because I find it nice to look at.
The goal is to have a very simple proof-checker that supports user-defined inductive data types/syntactic constructs, proof by induction, case analysis and maybe more.

[An example proof—a proof of totality of the addition on natural numbers.](https://gist.github.com/lambduli/d99a935f00845b910402d73976fa41a5)
