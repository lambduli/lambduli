# :sunflower: :deciduous_tree: :tulip: :blossom: Welcome to my PL garden :rose: :seedling: :hibiscus: :herb:

<!-- I think type systems, type theory, formal logic, proof theory and formal reasoning are really interesting topics. -->
I build small programming languages, theorem provers, and other systems related to PLT concepts.

## I sometimes write about the things I learn [:pencil2: **in my digital notepad** :blue_book:](http://reading.lambdu.li)
The latest published post was a report on [Propositions as Types ‚≠ê](http://reading.lambdu.li/reports/propositions-as-types)

## I am currently working on a PL oriented proof assistant :seedling:

## I am also working on a page about implementing various small type systems and languages. Hopefully to be seen soon.

## [You can take a look at my past projects](PROJECTS.md) :herb: :evergreen_tree:
